          <p>
            The first step was to find a font which had a number &lsquo;6&rsquo;
            that was almost perfectly circular. The font of choice in this case
            is Lato. The next step is to make the image fit inside the number.
            The trick is to pick an image and add it as a background-image of
            the number. The sizing is relatively easy by setting the
            background-size in em value. The positioning is
            trial&ndash;and&ndash;error, but doable. Another trick is to give
            the &lt;h1&gt; a viewport-relative font-size and style the inner
            elements (the &lsquo;6&rsquo;, &lsquo;brands&rsquo; and &lsquo;for
            the summer&rsquo;) with relative units, like ems, so they will
            always scale with the size of the title. (The font-sizes aren't
            bullet proof on large screens, but you get the idea)
